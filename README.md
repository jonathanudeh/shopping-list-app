- ✅ **Mark as Purchased**: Strike out purchased items with a checkbox.
- 🗑️ **Delete Items**: Remove unwanted items from the list.
- 📂 **Archive Items**: Move items to an archive for later reference.
- 🔄 **Unarchive Items**: Restore archived items back to the shopping list.
- 🌗 **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- 📌 **Grid/List View**: Switch between grid and list layouts.
